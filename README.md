## How to use
1. DO NOT right click and execute the start file as admin. Wait for the script to ask you
2. Wait and follow the instructions inside the script 
3. You can look into the info folder if something went wrong

4. Disable searching the web with windows search bar
5. Make programms close instantly when crash instead of collecting information
6. Clear Windows Temp and Bin -> Improve performance and free up some space
7. Restart Audio and Explorer.exe -> Fix issues
8. More REG edits like telementry (V.3)
9. Disable more useless Services (V.3)
10. The script will create "debug logs" / "outputs" for some of the commands, you can use those to see if something went wrong.
    e.g. if you receive and error and one of the files contains a text that tells you a specific command has to be executed with admin rights,
    you know that you have to restart the script with those rights. The script also creates a file with the information about the useragent
    and the device the script was executed on. It is named after your computers name using %computername% 
11. After that you can hit the "clear" file to clear the output logs
